Quick start flask single file template

jaf is a lightweight opinionated quick start template for flask
framework driven projects. This project is designed to allow me to hit
the ground running on small personal and client projects. It is not
meant to be used for a project larger then five pages.

Features:
  * Grunt Intergration: `./manage.py grunt-task`
  * Deploy Intergration: `./manage.py deploy`
